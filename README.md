# Alzheimer‚Äôs Protein‚ÄìProtein Interaction Prediction

This project presents a scalable framework for predicting missing or novel protein‚Äìprotein interactions (PPIs) associated with Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. It integrates graph-based modeling, biologically inspired learning, and high-dimensional encoding techniques to enhance prediction performance.

## üî¨ Overview

- **Graph Construction & Enrichment**
  - Based on known PPI interactions (e.g., from BioGRID/STRING).
  - Augmented using sequence, structural, and functional similarities.
  - Similarities are incorporated either as weighted edges or node features.

- **Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithm (DEAP)**
  - A graph-aware genetic algorithm is used to select informative features.
  - The refined feature set improves downstream GNN performance and preserves biological relevance.

- **Embedding Generation**
  - Protein nodes are encoded using a combination of:
    - **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**
    - **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
  - Fused embeddings capture diverse biological representations.

- **Link Prediction**
  - Combines cosine similarity (LAVA) and approximate nearest neighbor search (**Annoy**) for scalable PPI prediction.
  - Threshold-tuned predictions help control graph density and filter noise.

- **Distributed Processing**
  - Leverages **Ray** for parallel and scalable computations across stages such as embedding generation, prediction, and evaluation.
