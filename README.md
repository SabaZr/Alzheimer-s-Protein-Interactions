**üìù Title:** _Graph-Based Modeling of Alzheimer's Protein Interactions via Spiking Neural, Hyperdimensional Encoding, and Scalable Ray-Based Learning_  
**üë§ Author:** Saba Zare

This project introduces a scalable and biologically inspired framework to predict missing or novel protein‚Äìprotein interactions (PPIs) related to **Alzheimer‚Äôs disease**. It integrates graph modeling, hyperdimensional encoding, spiking neural networks (SNNs), and evolutionary feature selection for accurate and efficient link prediction.

## üî¨ Overview

- **Graph Construction**
  - Built from curated PPI databases (e.g., BioGRID, UniProt, KEGG).
  - Enriched using sequence, structural, and functional similarity.
  - Similarity scores are encoded as weighted edges or node attributes.

- **Feature Selection**
  - A graph-aware **Genetic Algorithm (via DEAP)** filters biologically relevant features.
  - Reduces dimensionality and enhances GNN performance.

- **Embedding & Learning**
  - Proteins are embedded using:
    - **Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)**
    - **Spiking Neural Networks (LIF neurons)**
    - **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**

- **Link Prediction**
  - Combines:
    - **LAVA** (cosine similarity metric)
    - **Annoy** (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)
  - Enables scalable and threshold-tuned PPI inference.

- **Distributed Computing**
  - Powered by **Ray** for parallel embedding generation, prediction, and evaluation.

## üîç Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search with Annoy

To efficiently perform similarity search among high-dimensional vectors (e.g., EEG features, HDC representations, or PPI embeddings), we use **Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**.

Annoy is a fast, memory-efficient library developed by Spotify for **approximate nearest neighbor search** in large datasets. It constructs a forest of random projection trees to partition the space and provides fast querying with a trade-off between accuracy and speed.

### üîß Key Features:
- Optimized for high-dimensional data
- Very fast at querying neighbors
- Suitable for large-scale problems (millions of vectors)
- Works well in both RAM and disk-based settings

### üß† Usage in this project:
We use Annoy to:
- Find similar brain signal representations
- Link related protein interaction patterns
- Speed up retrieval during training and evaluation phases
